# Typeflow

**Typeflow** is a modular, type-safe, deterministic visual programming interface that lets you **design, connect, and run Python workflows** through an intuitive visual editor.

It bridges **visual orchestration and real Python logic**, combining static typing, modularity, and local execution — perfect for **ETL flows, data pipelines, ML experiments, automation, and AI agent orchestration**.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Node-based architecture** — build workflows from functions and classes  
- **Type-safe execution** — full input/output validation and compilation  
- **Deterministic & synchronous** — predictable execution order  
- **Visual editor** — connect, edit, and run flows in a clean UI  
- **Local-first and secure** — no cloud dependency, all data stays local  
- **Single command setup** — `pip install typeflowapp` installs everything  
- **Env variable management in workflow** *(coming soon)*  
- **AI-assisted node logic** *(coming soon)*  
- **Asynchronous nodes and Loops** *(coming soon)*  
- **Public Nodes Registry and Community** *(coming soon)*  
- **Deployment** *(coming soon)*

## Works Great For

- Data and ETL workflows  
- ML and AI agent orchestration  
- Automation scripts and logic flows  
- Rapid prototyping of modular systems

## Install & Run

```bash
pip install typeflowapp
typeflow setup your_app_name
```

Then open the editor:

```bash
typeflow start-ui
```

And start connecting your nodes
